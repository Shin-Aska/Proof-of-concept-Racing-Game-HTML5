# Proof-of-concept-Racing-Game-HTML5
An outrun like game proof of concept made in HTML5. I just feel like doing it because I wanted to check and see if 2d Canvas is powerful enough for the task, unforuntately it is not.

Use this to learn more about 2d Canvas. For real work, I don't encourage doing this as 2d Canvas doesn't use GPU, I suggest using more powerful alternatives such as WebGL or engines like Pixi JS.
